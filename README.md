# floodriskgini
Simple Matlab code to illustrate the creation of Lorenz Curves and computation of the Gini index to quantify flood risk inequalities. Details about this method can be found in Sanders et al., ASCE OPEN, 2024. https://doi.org/10.1061/AOMJAH.AOENG-0017

This code is prepared to help researchers and practioners incorporate measures of social inequalities into flood risk research and management.

==========================================

This code demonstrates the development of two different types of Lorenz Curves, and the computation of a Gini index, relevant to flood risk inequalities across social groups. The first Lorenz Curve (and Gini metric) is to analyze inequalities in flood damage across a population, and the second Lorenz Curve (and Gini metric) is to analyze inequalities in flood exposure by social groups. 

The code begins with the creation of a synthetic dataset (Part I), transitions to a damage-based Lorenz/Gini application (Part II), and finishes with an exposure-based Lorenz/Gini application (Part III). 

Upon seeing the simplicity of the calculation, others can customize their own codes to carry out similar calculations as needed for applications.

The flood exposure-based Lorenz Curve and Gini index was first published in Sanders et al. Nat Sus, 2023. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-022-00977-7
The notation used in this code follows the notation presented Sanders et al. ASCE OPEN (2024).
